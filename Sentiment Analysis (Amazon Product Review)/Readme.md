**Project Overview**

**Problem Statement:
**The problem addressed in this project is the sentiment analysis of product reviews obtained from e-commerce websites. The primary challenge is to collect and analyze user-generated product reviews, classify them as positive, negative, or neutral, and extract valuable insights to aid businesses in making data-driven decisions.

**Methods and Tools:**

**Data Collection**: The data for this project will be collected by web scraping product reviews from e-commerce websites. Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests will be used for extracting textual data.

**Data Preprocessing**: The collected text data will undergo preprocessing, including cleaning (removing HTML tags, special characters, and punctuation), tokenization, and lowercasing.

**Feature Extraction**: Textual data will be transformed into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.

**Machine Learning Models**: Various machine learning models, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models, will be explored for sentiment analysis. Model evaluation will be based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Data Collection**:

The data for this project will be collected by scraping textual content from e-commerce websites, specifically product reviews. Web scraping involves fetching and parsing HTML pages to extract relevant information. Ethical considerations, including adherence to website terms of service and robots.txt files, will be followed during data collection.


**Conclusions**:

In conclusion, this project aims to perform sentiment analysis on product reviews collected from e-commerce websites. By collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing textual data, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer sentiments, product performance, and areas for improvement.

The results of this analysis can assist e-commerce companies in making informed decisions, optimizing product offerings, and enhancing customer satisfaction. This project showcases the application of web scraping, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis in the context of e-commerce.
